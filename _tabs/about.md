## Embracing the journey.

**So, what's my deal?**

I've been a Sales Engineer for the last 4 years in the exciting world of high-tech enterprise. I've been driving the development and distribution of storage products that people just can't get enough of. I've also been a Systems Engineer for some of the biggest Aerospace companies. From technical sales to systems validation, from _Cloud_ infrastructure to actual hardware in the real clouds, or above. I am try it all. It's been a wild ride, but I loved every minute of it!

**Any other interests?**

I guess I'm a thrill-seeker, adventurer with a deep love for the outdoors and nature, a passion for adrenaline sports and photography. When I'm not on the keyboard, you can find me in the trails from Otay to La Jolla on a gravel bike, carving down powdery slopes during ski season. I am also a bit of a cinephile, I can't resist re watching Breaking Bad's gritty drama or the timeless humor of Seinfeld. I also enjoy a good book, a good beer, and a good conversation.

I'm just a curious individual who's not shy to make things happen
